  "course_title": "Harmony and Counterpoint II",
  "course_description": "In this subject, we explore the harmonic, melodic, and formal practices of western music, principally the so-called \"Classical\" idiom of central Europe, ca. 1750-1825. Topics include a quick review of material covered in 21M.301, chromatic harmony (viio7, bII6, and chords of the augmented sixth), and chromatic modulation; lecture study and discussion are complemented by work in the keyboard laboratory and sight-singing laboratory. All areas of study will be integrated in a semester-long project of composing a theme and two variations in Classical style.\n",
